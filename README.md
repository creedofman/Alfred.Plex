##Plex Controller for Alfred 

Use the following key words to control your Plex Media Server directly from Alfred:

* **plex browse**: Browse your media library
* **plex search**: Search your media library


###Configuration###

Once you have the workflow installed you need to configure it to point to your Plex Media Server with the command:

**plex server** <server> <port:32400>

You should also select the client to use for playback:
**plex client**


###Attribution###

This project is heavily indebted to the initial work by David Ferguson (https://github.com/jdfwarrior/Alfred.Plex). Unfortunately, it didn't really work for me so I took the opportunity to rewrite it.
